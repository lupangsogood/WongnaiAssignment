        "description": "<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is the first decentralized digital currency that can be sent through the internet globally, without using an intermediary; such as financial institutions, like a (central) bank or agency. The Bitcoin transactions are controlled by many of its users, instead of a few entities. The processing of these transactions is called ‘mining’; new Bitcoin transactions, known as blocks, are added to the record of past transactions on the blockchain. In return, they get awarded with Bitcoin.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin was invented as a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no third party as an intermediary. Bitcoin was created because of a few main concerns of the inventor, like manipulation of the money supply, with inflation as result; profitable monopolies and oligopolies in financial services, such as the high fees for international money transfers; and tracking the money used by people.</p>\n<h3>Who started Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>In 2008, Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2009, Bitcoin was released as open-source software. Nakamoto’s real identity is still unknown, although there are many theories about who it might be. Decentralization is one of Bitcoin’s most important principles, and that’s why this anonymity is perfectly in line.</p>\n<h3>Bitcoin technology</h3>\n<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is a database, the so-called ‘ledger’, that consists of Bitcoin transaction records. For new transactions to be added to the ledger, the nodes must agree that the transaction is real and valid. The blockchain is public and contains records of all the transactions taking place.</p>",

Most of the online services, businesses and enterprises are built on a centralized system of governance. Ethereum aims to decentralize the existing client-server model; servers and clouds are replaced by so-called nodes, run by volunteers from all over the world. Ethereum’s vision is that it would enable this same functionality to people anywhere around the world, enabling them to compete to offer services on top of this infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>Who started Ethereum</h3>\n<p>Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin. In 2014, Buterin and the other co-founders launched a campaign where they sold ether (Ethereum tokens) to raise money to build their vision. Since the launch of the white paper in 2015, the platform has grown fast, and these days there are hundreds of developers involved.</p>",

It’s an electronic cash platform that allows peer-to-peer online cash payments to be made without the clearance of a clearinghouse. One of the most pressing issues for bitcoin has always been its scalability; the size of a block of transactions was limited to one MB. Bitcoin Cash was initiated to increase this block size.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin cash is very similar to bitcoin and also used as a payment system. Bitcoin Cash allows faster transaction times and lower transaction fees; it enabled the increase of the block size from one MB to eight MB. Its overall goal is to increase the number of transactions that can be processed by the network.</p>\n<h3>Who started Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash was officially released in August 2017, as a result of a discussion about the scalability of Bitcoin; the community had some concerns about Bitcoin’s ability to process the large number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. Looking for a solution, the community was divided into two groups. Unable to find a compromise, a hard fork was implemented, and Bitcoin Cash was created.</p>",

It features a faster transaction confirmation status, along with a refined storage competency.

The price of each litecoin is cheaper than bitcoin, and transactions are easier, because there are more Litecoins that can be created by mining. Litecoin is often referred to ‘silver’, whilst Bitcoin is compared with ‘gold.’</p>\n<h3>Who started Litecoin</h3>\n<p>In October 2011, litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub. (A client is a piece of software that accesses a service made available by a server.) It is basically a fork of the Bitcoin Core client. Charlie Lee is the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation. He’s an ex-Google employee who had the vision to create a lighter version of Bitcoin.</p>",

Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver lots of advanced features. It claims to be the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Cardano</h3>\n<p>In 2015, the Cardano project began as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed. The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration. Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. It started with a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. The Cardano platform now features decentralized applications and contracts that operate at low cost in a secure and scalable way.</p>\n<h3>Who started Cardano</h3>\n<p>Cardano was launched in 2017, and founded by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum. Charles said he wanted to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem for cryptocurrencies. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.</p>",
